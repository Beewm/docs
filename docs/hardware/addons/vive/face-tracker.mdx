# Vive Facial Tracker

The Vive Facial Tracker provides lower face tracking for [Vive Pro](../../vr/vive/vpe.mdx) and other VR headsets.
It connects to the computer via a short, built-in USB-C cable.
Face tracking data is accessed through [Vive's SRanipal interface](../..//vr/vive/sranipal.mdx).

**DISCONTINUED PRODUCT**

The Vive Facial Tracker has officially been discontinued by Vive. 
While it can still be used with VRCFT, expect no support for this product from Vive themselves.

## Why is this setup required?

The Vive Facial Tracker is a high bandwidth USB device sensitive to poor USB connectivity, leading to a lot of "gotchas" in hardware setup.
Also, the SRanipal software is notoriously annoying to deal with.

## Software Setup

:::tip
Install SRanipal first *before* plugging in the Vive Facial Tracker to make your life a bit easier.
:::

Regardless of what headset, the Vive Facial Tracker requires the computer that it connects to to have SRanipal runtime installed to be able to be used.
Follow the [SRanipal Setup](../..//vr/vive/sranipal.mdx#set-up) instructions to get this necessary software installed and ready.

## Hardware Setup

Setup for the Vive Facial Tracker will be split across different types of headset "categories".

- Vive Pro Series
- Valve Index / Other Wired VR headsets
- Quest / other Standalone with PC Streaming

There are some special notes for certain headsets and setup methods in the last section.

Once SRanipal is installed and the facial tracker connected to the computer and powered on, SRanipal might be unresponsive for a while the Facial Tracker updates its firmware.
During this time you will see the Vive Facial Tracker show up as "HTC Boot" in Windows Device Manager.
:::danger
Do **NOT** unplug the face tracker while it is in this state.
:::
When it finishes, there should be a little pop-up notification (possibly hidden under other windows) saying that the lip tracker firmware was successfully updated, and now
you should be able to see a "HTC Multimedia Camera" device instead in Device Manager.

:::info
A poor USB connection for the Facial Tracker can lead to it getting stuck trying to update its firmware, never initializing.
If possible, the plug the facial tracker **directly into a USB-C port on your computer** to allow it to "update".
The face tracker does not actually need a firmware update, however, disabling firmware auto update in the SRanipal config does not address the fundamental issue of a poor connection and also adds more problems.

### Vive Pro Series

This is by far the easiest headset(s) to set up the Vive Facial Tracker for, as it was made for these headsets.
Follow the [official Vive Facial Tracker installation instructions](https://www.vive.com/us/support/facial-tracker/category_howto/tracker.html)

    <summary>Vive Pro Mounting Alternatives</summary>
    <div>The adhesive that comes with the Vive Facial Tracker isnâ€™t the best, and can easily fail with a knock to the headset. Here are some alternative mounting solutions</div>

        <li><a href={"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5405617"}>3D printed alternative Mount</a></li>
        <li>Use 3M VHB Tape as adhesive replacement</li>
        <li>Wrap rubber bands around the facial tracker mounting legs and whole headset (ask Azmidi...)</li>
        <li>Wrap a wire around everything??? (ask PLPlolol in the <a href={"https://discord.gg/vrcft"}>VRCFT Discord</a>...)</li>

### Valve Index / Wired VR Headsets

The position of the Vive Facial Tracker relative to your lower face is *very important*.
More often than not bad tracking is the result of a bad position/angle of the facial tracker.
Getting a good 3D printed mount is essential for avoiding tracking issues on non-Vive Pro headsets.
Look and ask around in the [VRCFT Discord](https://discord.gg/vrcft) if you need suggestions.

#### Valve Index

This section assume you are intending to use a USB-C female to USB-A Male USB adapter in the Index "frunk" USB 3.0 port.

- Get a **USB 3.0 or higher** USB-C female to USB-A Male USB adapter, such as https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B083XXLW77

:::caution
This is the **#1 reason** for VRCFaceTracking problems with Index users.
**DO NOT BUY THE SHORT STUBBY USB-2.0 ADAPTERS**. A proper USB 3.0+ adapter will be "long"!
:::

- Remove the front plate covering the frunk area of the Index.

- Connect the Facial Tracker to the adapter, and the adapter into the frunk USB port directly. Using a USB hub in the frunk *can* cause issues.
- Mounting options for the Valve Index

:::info
The Index frunk area can get quite warm, and the USB adapters can get **very hot**, making the headset heat worse. 
If possible, try to keep the front of the headset actively cooled with a fan, and/or add a heatsink to the USB adapter.
:::

#### Other Wired VR Headsets

Get a quality **USB 3.0 or better USB** extension. Since USB-C female extensions are rare, if you are getting a USB-C female to USB-A Male USB adapter, follow the :ref:`Valve Index` adapter instructions.

### Quest / other Standalone with PC Streaming

Using the headset as a VirtualHere USB server is a possible solution that allows for a fully wireless setup.
VRCFT member `Blackspots#0001` has a nice [reddit post detailing the process](https://www.reddit.com/r/Quest2/comments/xlvbc8/getting_the_vive_face_tracker_to_work_with_the/) for the Quest 2
This proceed *may* work for other similar headsets (Pico 3, Pico 4, etc.).  

## Module

Install the **"SRanipalTrackingModule"** from the [VRCFaceTracking Module Registry](../../..//vrcft-software/vrcft.mdx#module-registry).
